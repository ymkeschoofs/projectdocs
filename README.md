Repository that illustrates the basics of HTML and CSS — part of the Grafische en Digitale Media learning materials. 

## Introduces fundamental concepts in HTML and CSS.

Serves as a starting point for students in Digital & Graphic Media (AP Antwerp) to explore structure, semantic elements, styling, and basic layout.
Contains simple, annotated example code that is easy to read, run, and modify.
Enables learners to experiment, break things, and then understand how changes affect rendering in the browser.

## A live version of this repository is deployed at:
https://aphtml00.netlify.app/ 


Use the live demo to quickly see how the HTML + CSS are rendered, and to validate that your local version behaves equivalently.

Typical contents of this repository include:
index.html 
the main HTML file demonstrating document structure, elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.
assets/ 
folder for stylesheets, images, or other supporting files.
.gitignore 
to exclude system files or build artifacts.
README.md 
this file, explaining the repository’s purpose, structure, how to run / test, and guidelines.


##  Usage Instructions
Clone or fork the repo:
git clone https://github.com/Grafische-en-Digitale-Media/AP_HTML_00_start.git

Open index.html in your browser to see the rendered page.

Edit the HTML / CSS files (e.g. in assets/) to experiment with layout, colors, typography, structure, etc.

Use your browser’s developer tools (Inspect, CSS inspector) to see how changes affect the DOM / styles in real time.

##  Suggested Next Steps (in the curriculum)
Once students are comfortable with this starter repository, they may proceed to:
More advanced HTML topics (forms, accessibility)
CSS layout techniques (flexbox, grid)
Responsive design (media queries, fluid layouts)
Introducing JavaScript for interactivity
Eventually server-side or build tooling via Node.js
